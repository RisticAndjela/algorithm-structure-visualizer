# Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive learning platform for understanding data structures and algorithms by **watching each operation happen step by step**.

The project is built with **Blazor WebAssembly and C#**. Its goal is not only to display the final result of an algorithm, but to explain:

- what the algorithm is doing;
- which element is currently being inspected;
- why that element is visited next;
- how many operations were required;
- what the time complexity means for the current run;
- how the visual representation differs from the way the data is stored in memory.

The first fully implemented learning module is **Queue & Stack**. It serves as the reference architecture and UX pattern for all future algorithms and data structures.

# Core implementation rule

## Algorithms and data structures are implemented from scratch

A central rule of this project is:

> **Do not use a ready-made library implementation for an algorithm or data structure that the application is supposed to teach.**

For example, the Queue and Stack implementations do **not** use:

```csharp
Stack<T>
Queue<T>
List<T>
LinkedList<T>
```

as their algorithmic storage implementation.

They also do not delegate important storage operations to helpers such as:

```csharp
Array.Copy(...)
Array.Sort(...)
BinarySearch(...)
```

Instead, the current linear structures use a custom:

```csharp
ManualDynamicArray<T>
```

which is backed directly by:

```csharp
T[]
```

The project manually implements:

- capacity growth;
- allocation of a larger backing array;
- copying existing references with a loop;
- indexed access;
- insertion at the end;
- deletion at an index;
- shifting later references to the left;
- clearing used slots;
- `Count`;
- `Capacity`.

This rule will also apply to future trees, graphs, heaps, sorting algorithms and search algorithms.

Standard .NET infrastructure such as `Task`, `CancellationToken`, `Guid`, `SemaphoreSlim`, Blazor components and browser interop may still be used. These provide application infrastructure rather than the algorithm being taught.

# Queue & Stack

Queue and Stack began as a simple simulation of four operations:

- Stack: `Push` / `Pop`
- Queue: `Enqueue` / `Dequeue`

The module has since been expanded into a complete learning environment.

---

## Stack

The Stack follows the **LIFO** rule:

> Last In, First Out.

Implemented operations:

- `Push`
- `Pop`
- `Reset`
- Find by value
- Find by ID
- Delete by value
- Delete by ID

Search traversal starts at:

```text
TOP → bottom
```

When searching or deleting, the simulator checks one element at a time in the same order a Stack traversal would follow.

---

## Queue

The Queue follows the **FIFO** rule:

> First In, First Out.

Implemented operations:

- `Enqueue`
- `Dequeue`
- `Reset`
- Find by value
- Find by ID
- Delete by value
- Delete by ID

Search traversal starts at:

```text
FRONT → rear
```

The simulator does not secretly locate the result before the animation starts. The algorithm itself checks each element until a match is found or the complete Queue has been inspected.

---

# Element identity

Every element is its own object.

An element contains:

- a value;
- an internal `Guid`;
- a short learner-facing ID;
- its current visual simulation state.

For example:

```text
value: 7
ID:    #A1B2C3
```

and:

```text
value: 7
ID:    #F4E5D6
```

are two different elements even though they contain the same value.

This is intentional.

Duplicate values are valid because:

```text
same value != same object
```

This distinction makes it possible to teach both:

- search by value;
- search by exact element identity.

The learner only needs the short displayed ID. Full GUID values are intentionally hidden from the UI.

---

# Search simulation

Both Stack and Queue support:

```text
Find by value
Find by ID
```

Search is implemented as a real linear traversal.

For every checked element, the simulation can show:

- the current element;
- its value;
- its short ID;
- whether it matches;
- how many elements have been checked;
- which direction the traversal is moving.

Typical visual states include:

```text
checking
visited
matched
adding
removing
pointer target
```

If the requested value or ID does not exist, the algorithm checks the entire structure.

A missing short ID therefore produces a real not-found traversal instead of being rejected by the UI before the algorithm starts.

---

# Delete simulation

Both structures support:

```text
Delete by value
Delete by ID
```

Delete is deliberately shown as two pieces of work:

1. **Find the target**
2. **Remove it from storage**

If no matching element is found, the structure remains unchanged.

If a match is found, the simulator records:

- how many comparisons were required;
- the backing-array index of the match;
- how many references were shifted;
- `Count` before and after deletion;
- `Capacity` before and after deletion;
- the complexity of the traversal;
- the complexity of the complete operation.

---

# What happens in memory after deletion?

The current Queue and Stack implementations use the custom `ManualDynamicArray<T>`.

Suppose the backing array contains:

```text
[ A ][ B ][ C ][ D ]
```

and `B` is removed.

The implementation manually shifts the later references:

```text
[ A ][ C ][ D ][ empty ]
```

The used part of the structure therefore contains **no logical hole**.

Internally, the algorithm performs this shift itself with a loop.

`Count` decreases, while `Capacity` normally stays unchanged.

For example:

```text
Count:    4 → 3
Capacity: 4 → 4
```

The removed object is no longer referenced by this structure. If no other reference to that object exists, the .NET garbage collector may reclaim it later.

The application does not pretend to display real RAM addresses. Learning labels such as:

```text
MEM-#A1B2C3
```

represent object identity only.

---

# Visual state vs Memory state

A major learning feature of the project is the separation between:

## Visual state

The structure is drawn in the form that best explains its rules.

For example:

- Stack is displayed vertically;
- its top element is marked;
- Queue shows its front and rear;
- active elements are highlighted during traversal.

## Memory state

The same data is shown from the point of view of its storage implementation.

The memory view explains:

- backing-array slots;
- occupied vs reserved capacity;
- references;
- individual element objects;
- IDs;
- values;
- shifts caused by deletion.

These views are intentionally separate.

A drawing used to explain an algorithm is **not necessarily the same as the program's memory layout**.

This distinction is especially important for future Graph and Tree modules, where nodes may be positioned visually for readability while the underlying data is stored using arrays, indexes, references or other structures.

---

# Complexity explanations

The simulator does not display only a generic Big-O label.

It distinguishes between:

- the amount of work performed during the current run;
- the general worst-case complexity of the operation.

The learning UI uses:

### `n`

The total number of elements in the structure.

### `k`

How far the current traversal actually travelled.

### `O(1)`

The amount of work does not grow with the number of stored elements.

### `O(n)`

The worst-case amount of work can grow linearly with the number of elements.

### `Θ(k)`

The current run inspected only part of the structure.

### `Θ(n)`

The current run inspected the complete structure.

Example:

If the first Queue element matches the search target:

```text
comparisons: 1
current traversal: Θ(1)
worst case: O(n)
```

If the target is missing:

```text
comparisons: n
current traversal: Θ(n)
worst case: O(n)
```

For deletion, traversal work and storage-shift work are reported separately so that the learner can see that finding an item and physically removing it from an array-backed structure are not always the same cost.

---

# Simulation controls

The project contains a shared simulation runtime used by the algorithms.

Available controls include:

- Play
- Pause
- Step forward
- Step back
- Reset
- adjustable step delay

Algorithm code uses asynchronous simulation steps, allowing every meaningful change to pause and become visible before execution continues.

The simulation runtime handles:

- run state;
- pause state;
- single-step execution;
- speed changes;
- cancellation;
- current-step explanation.

---

## Step back

Actual C# execution is not reversed.

Instead, the UI records visual snapshots during a run.

`Step back` lets the learner review a previous snapshot.

`Step forward` moves through the recorded history. Once the learner reaches the newest live frame, stepping forward can continue the real simulation.

This preserves correct algorithm state while still allowing the learner to review previous steps.

---

# Result explanations

After Find and Delete operations, the application can show a **Last Run** explanation.

The explanation contains two views:

## What happened

Shows:

- whether the element was found;
- number of checks;
- current-run complexity;
- full-operation complexity;
- worst-case complexity.

## Memory

Explains:

- which element was removed;
- which slot was affected;
- whether references moved;
- whether an empty logical position remained;
- how `Count` changed;
- how `Capacity` changed;
- what can happen to the removed object afterward.

Automatic result popups can be disabled.

The most recent explanation remains available manually even when automatic popups are turned off.

---

# Guided Practice

The Queue & Stack page contains practical exercises.

Tasks are not simple checkboxes.

The learner presses **Start task**, performs the required operations, and the application observes what happens.

A task becomes `Completed` only after its required scenario has actually been performed.

Current exercises cover scenarios such as:

- building Stack and Queue;
- predicting `Pop` and `Dequeue`;
- finding by ID;
- finding by value;
- deleting by ID;
- deleting by value;
- duplicate values;
- existing targets;
- missing targets;
- missing IDs;
- deleting the same value multiple times;
- searching for an element after deleting it;
- empty structures;
- one-element structures;
- deletion from the middle of the backing array;
- observing memory shifts;
- mixed final exercises.

Completed task progress is stored locally in the browser.

# Concepts & Memory

The application includes a dedicated learning page:

```text
/learn/concepts
```

It provides simple explanations for concepts reused across the simulations, including:

- LIFO;
- FIFO;
- `n`;
- `k`;
- `O(1)`;
- `O(n)`;
- `Θ(...)`;
- value vs identity;
- object vs reference;
- `Count`;
- `Capacity`;
- memory allocation;
- garbage collection;
- Visual state vs Memory state.

The page starts with short beginner-friendly explanations and provides links to deeper external documentation for learners who want more detail.

# Architecture

The solution is split into two main projects.

```text
AlgorithmVisualizer.sln

src/
├── AlgorithmVisualizer.Core/
└── AlgorithmVisualizer.Client/
```

## `AlgorithmVisualizer.Core`

Contains algorithm and data-structure behavior.

Responsibilities include:

- structure state;
- manual data-structure implementation;
- traversal;
- mutation;
- complexity information;
- simulation-step descriptions.

Core code does not render UI.

Relevant Queue/Stack files include:

```text
DataStructures/
└── Linear/
    ├── LinearElement.cs
    ├── LinearStructureSimulationBase.cs
    ├── LinearTraversalResult.cs
    ├── ManualDynamicArray.cs
    ├── Stack/
    │   └── StackSimulation.cs
    └── Queue/
        └── QueueSimulation.cs
```

## `AlgorithmVisualizer.Client`

Blazor WebAssembly presentation layer.

Responsibilities include:

- Razor pages and components;
- visual rendering;
- memory rendering;
- playback controls;
- simulation history;
- guided practice;
- result modals;
- browser-local learning preferences and progress.

The Core project depends on the simulation runtime through:

```csharp
ISimulationRuntime
```

The Blazor client provides the concrete:

```csharp
SimulationState
```

This keeps algorithms independent from rendering concerns.

---

# Technology

- C#
- .NET 8
- Blazor WebAssembly
- Razor components
- CSS isolation
- WebAssembly
- minimal browser JS interop for local browser storage

The algorithmic and simulation logic is implemented in C#.

Razor and CSS are used for the presentation layer.

JavaScript/TypeScript is not used to implement the algorithms.

---

# Learning design principles

Every future module should follow the same principles established by Queue & Stack.

## 1. Show the algorithm, do not hide it

If an operation requires traversing five elements, the learner should see all five checks.

## 2. Use the real algorithmic order

Animations must reflect the actual implementation.

## 3. Explain the current run

Do not show only theoretical worst-case complexity.

## 4. Separate visual shape from memory storage

The teaching diagram and the storage model may differ.

## 5. Keep explanations beginner-friendly

Technical terms should be introduced only when they add learning value and should be explained in simple language.

## 6. Do not fake interactivity

A module without an implemented algorithm remains explicitly marked as TODO.

## 7. Implement teaching algorithms manually

Do not replace an implementation with a framework collection or library algorithm that hides the behavior being taught.

---

# Next implementation direction

Queue & Stack establishes the reusable foundation for future modules:

```text
algorithm
    ↓
simulation steps
    ↓
playback runtime
    ↓
visual state
    ↓
memory state
    ↓
complexity explanation
    ↓
guided practice
```

Future Tree, Graph, Sorting and Search modules should reuse this learning model while providing their own manually implemented algorithms and data structures.

---

## Current milestone

**Queue & Stack: implemented and expanded into the first complete learning module.**

The project is now ready to use this module as the reference pattern for the next algorithm or data structure.
